# google-homepage

2021, March 28th

This is my first project from The Odin Project. Watch [Demo](https://thanh-luan-nguyen.github.io/google-homepage/)

This is the **easy** version - I built the Google.com homepage (only appearance, no functionality).

For more details on the objectives of this project, follow this [link](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css)
